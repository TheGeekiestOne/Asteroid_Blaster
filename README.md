# Asteroid_Blaster
OpenGL + FreeGLUT version of 2D asteroids

# Description
You are to build a simple 2D game in OpenGL by using the Freeglut library. To create a mock-up of the 2D Asteroid game/

The game scenario consists of a 'spaceship' in the centre of the screen. The
‘asteroids’ appear at the start of the game and the spaceship can turn freely about
its axis by and fire missiles at the asteroids. The asteroids themselves do not
translate but rotate about their axis. Different speeds can be used.
You should be able to change between the grid and the pattern with the help of a
pop-up menu as can be seen on the figures. Also, blending has been applied to the
background.
